--- Lane Following System for Autonomous Vehicle with Computer Vision (ANN) ---

I can only share octave codes. You need to create the Unity environment yourself. The model is already trained.
It starts with the 'start' function.

It uses two different ANNs created solely with algorithms and mathematics, which enable it to slow down on bends and follow the lane.
